In recent times, there has been much debate about the victims of domestic violence. Domestic violence is any
form of abuse that occurs within the household. It includes marital conflicts leading to physical confrontation
by both or one of the partners, aggression by parents on children, and vice versa. Domestic violence, as
described by an expert from the Liga Mocgambicana dos Direitos Humanos (LMDH) in Maputo, can also
consist of moral violence. Moral violence means intimidation and insults that lead to tense situations,
sometimes with serious outcomes.
According to the records of some years ago, 85% of domestic violence cases were dealt with by LMDH. The
other 15 % were cases of child abuse, child labour and violence or discrimination against the handicapped.
The handicapped suffered discrimination in public places and when going for employment interviews.
Of the total cases of domestic violence reported, 99% were reported in cities and small towns, with 14% of
the cases coming from Tete, Beira and Quelimane and 27% from the northern cities. Our capital city,
Maputo, is responsible for most of the cases, with more than half of the overall total. It is curious and
surprising to note that a few cases, 0.5 % of the total, were domestic violence cases in which men were the
victims.
