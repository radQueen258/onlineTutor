Life on earth is full of different species. Each species is adapted to a different ---16---. All you have to do is
look around and observe.

In a forest, species specialization can be seen in the layer system of ---17--- life. Animals that live on the top
of the trees dare not come to the ground. It is too dangerous for them. Besides, all ---18--- and shelter that
they need to survive is on the top ---19--- of the forest. The same can be said about the ---20--- in the middle
layer and in the ground layer. Other species, like some type of bacteria, have to live inside the ---21--- of
other animals to survive. If they go in to the open for long, they die.

unlike other species, humans reasoned and wanted to change nature, they started feeding themselves from
their natural ---23---. They wanted to have a more comfortable life.

If we are careful enough to observe nature, we will see that humans are the biggest ---24--- living on earth
today. They are used to doing only what they want, and not what they must. They are not used to doing what
they ought to do in favour of life in this ---25---.
