The development of science and technology has brought new developments in the area of medicine.
An important development in medicine was the invention of anesthesia. According to the history of
medicine, many years ago, if one was to go for a surgery operation, this person had to be beaten with a
hammer to faint. They, then would operate on him/her. It was painful and risky since in some occasions
patients never recovered from the fainting! Nowadays, before any surgery the person gets an injection of
anesthesia, whichmakes him/her feel nothing during the surgery. It is easier than the hammer method!
Modern medicines also invented incubators. Incubators are small containers used for keeping premature
babies alive. Many years ago, if children were born prematurely, they died, because of lack of medical aid.
Nowadays, if a child is born prematurely, he/she is put in an incubator, an environment close to his/her
mother’s womb.
Another important development in medicine was the invention of vaccination. Modern vaccines can
prevent diseases through vaccination. Many diseases like polio and small pox have been eradicated because
of vaccination. In Mozambique there are many vaccination campaign against different diseases like
malaria.
