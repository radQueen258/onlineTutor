Women play an important role in Mozambique. They do a lot to build our nation. Many women in our
country have important jobs. They work as nurses, doctors, journalists, soldiers and teachers.
During the liberation struggle, women took part in many important activities. Some prepared food for the
fighters and others worked as radio operators, teachers and nurses.
In our traditional societies, women were exploited by men. Man used to have many wives. They used them to
work in their fields. The more women a man had, the richer he became. As the men became richer, the
women became poorer.
The women worked hard, from morning till evening. They came home and they still had to prepare the meal
for the family. They also had to fetch water. Women had to eat last. When there wasn’t enough food, they
had to go to bed hungry.
At the time, women could not speak out. They were not allowed to make decisions. The men made all
decisions for them. For example, women were not allowed to speak in court. They had to be presented by
men. They could not speak in public either.
Now all is different, men and women share the same rights. Women do have the voice in society and they
cannot be used by men any more. In our country, women have an organization called the “Organization of
Mozambican Women” (OMM), one of the aims of this organization is to stop men from exploiting women
and to fight against bad traditions which make women inferior.
