Polio is an illness, which can attack people of any age, but it is especially dangerous with young children.
The disease begins with a high temperature, vomiting, diarrhoea and ey muscles Polio jah kill the
muscles in a person’s legs, and anyone who gets this disease can become crippled for life. One or both
legs may become thin. Polio can also kill the muscles in a child’s throat. When this happens, the child
cannot breathe and as a result it dies.

(Polio can be prevented by three doses of a vaccine called Sabin. UN baby must get the first polio vaccine
when it is three months old. At four and a half months, a baby must get the second vaccine, and when it
reaches six months, it must get the last dose. Children must be vaccinated against polio in the first six
months of their lives. When a baby has been vaccinated against polio three times, it is immune; it is safe
and cannot catch the disease.

For the polio vaccine to be effective, it must be kept in a fridge. If it is allowed to get warm, the people
who are vaccinated with it will not be safe from the disease.

¥ Young babies must be immunised against other dangerous diseases such as tetanus, diphtheria,
tuberculosis and whooping cough. However, vaccinations do not cure all diseases. They only prevent
people from getting those diseases against which they are immunised.
