Section I: Read the following text and then answer the questions below according to the
information given in the text. (There are 5 marks for this section.)

In the humid tropical regions of the world, there is no country where the coconut has not been planted
either for the market or for subsistence. Mozambique is the largest coconut producer in Africa and
coconuts are an important export product. The palm mainly grows in coastal regions of the provinces of
Zambezia and Inhambane. Some of the largest single plantations in the world are to be found here.

The coconut has eared its name “tree of life” through its many useful products. There are hardly any
parts of the palm that are left unused.

The dried flesh of the coconut itself is called copra. The oil that is produced from copra is the most
important single product of the tree. For many years it has been important cooking oil and is used in the
manufacture of margarine. In recent years it has been widely used as an ingredient in sweets. Apart from
its use as a food product, coconut oil has a wide range of applications as an industrial vegetable oil, for
example in soaps and other cleansing agents as well as cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, explosives and paints.

The flesh of the coconut can also be dried and grated to produce desiccated coconut, which is used in the
manufacture of cakes and sweets.

The shell of the coconut can be used as a domestic fuel for cooking and for making charcoal.

The leaves of the coconut are widely used for domestic purposes such as mats. They can also be used as a
roofing material.

People enjoy eating the flesh of the coconut, which is considered a great delicacy; however, it is an
expensive vegetable since the whole tree has to be destroyed to obtain one flesh.
