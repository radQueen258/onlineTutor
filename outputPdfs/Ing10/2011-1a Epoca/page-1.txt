Climate change is a reality. Today, our world is hotter than it has been for two thousand years. By the end of
the century, if current trends continue, the global temperature will probably be higher than at any time in the
past two million years. Global warming is one of the most serious challenges we are facing today. We must
reduce emissions of heat- trapping gases if we are to protect the environment, health and economic well-
being of present and future generations.

Global warming is caused by emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. Certain gases in the
atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, lead to a “greenhouse effect”, stopping heat from escaping and keeping
the Earth warm enough to sustain life. Although carbon dioxide is not the most powerful of these gases, it is
the most significant, in terms of human effects because of the large quantities that are emitted. Carbon
dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are now the highest in 150,000 years.

Carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are emitted primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. For more
than a century, people have relied on burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas for their energy needs.
Factories, power stations and cars are all pumping out pollution into the atmosphere. The clearing of forests
has a similar effect by reducing the number of trees available to use up carbon dioxide in the process of
photosynthesis.

The 1990’s was probably the warmest decade in history, and 1998 the warmest year. There is widespread
agreement that a certain amount of additional warming- about 1,3° Celsius is probably inevitable because of
emissions so far. But it is considered vital that we limit warming to under 2° Celsius if we are to prevent the
worst effects of climate change.

If our greenhouse gas emissions are not brought under control, the speed of climate change over the next
hundred years will be faster than anything known since before the dawn of civilization.
