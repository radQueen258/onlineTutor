Intensive cultivation has obliged farmers and farming companies to make use of products that can rapidly
and efficiently replace the nutrients in soils that plants feed on.

Fertilizers can act directly on the plants, providing them with large quantities of nutrients or, they can act
indirectly by penetrating the soil and reaching it. Manure is one of the products that farmers use to improve
soil quality. Manure has high content of nutrients (macronutrients) that are directly used by the plants. It
allows for more absorption of nutrients which help plants grow faster and bigger.

Apart from manure, farmers also use pesticides for improved yields. For better growth of the plants and high
productivity, it is important to protect the plants from pests and diseases.

There are many pests known by human kind ever since the Egyptians started recording the events of the
Earth in writing. For instance, locusts have swarmed fields and devastated entire countries such as Egypt,
Chad, Mauritania and some Southern Africa countries near Mozambique. Other pests include termites, rats,
flies, several species of insects, ants, bugs and lice. All these pests can be controlled with pesticides and
biological mechanisms. Every pest has its own natural enemies, it helps fields to keep free from them.
