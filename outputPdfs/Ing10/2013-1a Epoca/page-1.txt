The Amazon forest, in Brazil, covers five million square kilometres-an area as big as the whole Europe
excluding Russia. It contains one third of the world’s trees.

However, the trees are disappearing. By 1974, a quarter of the forest had already been cut down. In the
following year, 1975, 4% of the remaining trees were also cut down. If the destruction of the forest continues
at the same rate, there will be nothing left by the year 2020.

Scientists say that the disappearance of the trees is already causing changes in the climate. In Peru, there is
less snow than before on the high peaks of the Andes Mountains. In Bolivia, there is less rain than before and
more wind. In some parts of North-east Brazil there is now very little rain.

What will happen if more of the Amazon forest is cut down? According to climatologists, two things are
likely to happen: there will be serious effects on the world’s climate, and the air that we breathe will lose
some of its oxygen.

Trees absorb the gas carbon dioxide from the air, and give out oxygen into the air. The trees of the Amazon
rain forest are chemically very active, and some scientists believe that they provide 50% of the world’s
annual production of oxygen. If we lose the tropical forests, the air will contain less oxygen and more carbon
dioxide. It will become difficult-perhaps even impossible-to breathe.

With more carbon dioxide in the air, the temperature will rise, the ice-caps at the North and South poles will
melt, the sea level will rise, and hundreds of coastal cities will become flooded.

Scientists do not all agree about the exact figures-the calculations can be done in different ways with
different results. But all scientists agree that if we destroy the Amazon forest it will be environmental

suicide-like losing an ocean. Life on Earth will become difficult, and it may become impossible.
