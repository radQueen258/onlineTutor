Slaves were brought to Africa in the 1670s. They were usually men and came mainly from the East Indies,
but also from east and West Africa. Slaves had to work without pay for the person who owned them. They
were mainly used for manual labour in the Cape, although many slaves were skilled workers as well. Manual
labour means working with your body, doing work like digging, carrying heavy things, or washing dishes.
Skilled workers can do things that need knowledge and skill, such as sewing, woodwork, cooking and
farming, Slavery was only abolished in South Africa in 1834.
‘The arrival of these farmers made a big difference to the people who were already in the area. The Khoikhoi
were stopped from using the Liesbeek River, which were their most valuable grazing land and water source.
A long wooden fence, made from thousands of trees, was built to stop them going into the area claimed by
the Dutch.
This was the very first time in. Southern Africa that laws were made to mark off land and give it to one
person to own. These laws also affected how people lived in the Liesbeek valley. The Khoikhoi would have
found this idea as crazy as we would if we tried to mark out a portion of the sky for our own private use.
